# odin-calculator

From the Odin-Project:
>You made it! By now you should have a really firm grasp on the fundamentals of JavaScript. Of course there’s plenty more to learn, but you should be able to create quite a bit at this point. Our final project is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

>As usual with these things, there are elements of this project that are not going to be trivially easy for you, but if you’ve been following the course so far, you definitely have everything you need to finish it. We’re going to walk you through the various steps you can take, but again, how you actually implement them is up to you!
